## How do I install these formulae?

Using a formula's fully qualified name:

```
brew install dnlggr/tap/<formula>
```

Or by first tapping this repo and then installing a formula as usual:

```
brew tap dnlggr/tap
brew install <formula>
```

Or by installing a formula via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnlggr/homebrew-tap/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```
